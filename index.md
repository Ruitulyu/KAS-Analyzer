### Introduction

KAS-pipe2 is a collection of command line tools specifically developped for exploring KAS-seq or strand-specific (sp)KAS-seq data, including the basic processing tools for quality control, reference genome index, raw reads mapping, and heatmaps and summary plots. KAS-pipe2 also includes many novel features and completely new frame design compared to KAS-pipe. e.g. time-courese(TC) KAS-seq differential analysis, R-loop identification (only for spKAS-seq), ss-enhancers, motif, index calculation, termination length and so on.

KAS-pipe2 is still on active development and the source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ruitulyu/KAS-pipe2).

### Installation

**Install by cloning KAS-pipe2 git repository on github:**

You can install KAS-pipe2 on command line (linux/mac) by cloning git repository on github:

	$ git clone https://github.com/Ruitulyu/KAS-pipe2.git
	$ cd KAS-pipe2
	$ bash ./setup.sh
	
	# If anaconda or miniconda was not installed on your system.
	$ KAS-pipe2 install -conda
	
	# Install conda 'KAS-pipe2' environment. 
	$ KAS-pipe2 install -KAS-pipe2
	
	# Activate conda 'KAS-pipe2' environment.
	$ KAS-pipe2 activate
	

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Ruitulyu/KAS-pipe2/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Ruitulyu/KAS-pipe2/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
