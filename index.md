### Introduction

KAS-pipe2 is a collection of command line tools specifically developped for exploring KAS-seq or strand-specific (sp)KAS-seq data, including the basic processing tools for quality control, reference genome index, raw reads mapping, and heatmaps and summary plots. KAS-pipe2 also includes many novel features and completely new frame design compared to KAS-pipe. e.g. time-courese(TC) KAS-seq differential analysis, R-loop identification (only for spKAS-seq), ss-enhancers, motif, index calculation, termination length and so on.

KAS-pipe2 is still on active development and the source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ruitulyu/KAS-pipe2).

### Installation

**Install by cloning KAS-pipe2 git repository on github:**

You can install KAS-pipe2 on command line (linux/mac) by cloning git repository on github:

	$ git clone https://github.com/Ruitulyu/KAS-pipe2.git
	$ cd KAS-pipe2
	$ bash ./setup.sh
	
	# If anaconda or miniconda was not installed on your system.
	$ KAS-pipe2 install -conda
	
	# Install conda 'KAS-pipe2' environment. 
	$ KAS-pipe2 install -KAS-pipe2
	
	# Activate conda 'KAS-pipe2' environment.
	$ KAS-pipe2 activate

#### Usage:
KAS-pipe2 sub-command [options]

#### The KAS-pipe2 sub-commands include:

##### Configure
```	
   download        Downlaod the index of reference genome for aligners (bowtie, bowtie2, bwa, star).
   build           Build the index of reference genome for aligners (bowtie, bowtie2, bwa, star).
   install         Install and check the 'KAS-pipe2' conda environment; check the installation of tools.
   uninstall       Uninstall the 'KAS-pipe2' conda environment.
   activate        Activate the 'KAS-pipe2' conda environment.
   deactivate      Deactivate the 'KAS-pipe2' conda environment.
```
	
##### Fastqc
```
   fastqc          Generate basic quality control metrics for KAS-seq data.
   readsnum        Calcuate the reads number of raw fastq files.
   statistics      Calculate the mapping statistics for KAS-seq data.
   FRiP            Calculate the fraction of reads in peaks.
   fragmentsize    Measure the fragment size of paired-end KAS-seq data.
   correlation     Calculate the correlation coefficient and pvalue, generate correlation plot for replicates of KAS-seq data.
   saturation      Perform saturation analysis for KAS-seq data.
   complexity      Calculate the complexity metric for (sp)KAS-seq data, including the PCR Bottlenecking Coefficient and Non-Redundant Fraction (NRF).

   fingerprint     Plot fingerprint for KAS-seq data.
```
##### Mapping
```
   trim            Trim adapter and low quality sequence, perform quality control for raw KAS-seq data.
   KAS-seq         Align KAS-seq data to the reference genome, deduplicate mapped reads, and generate several files with maped reads (bam, bed and bedGraph).
   spKAS-seq       Align strand specific KAS-seq (spKAS-seq) data. Note: we strongly recommend paired-end sequencing for spKAS-seq data to accurately measure the fragment size.
   peakscalling    Call broad or sharp peaks for KAS-seq data.
   normalize       Normalize KAS-seq data with bedGraph density files.
   bedGraphToBigWig Transfer normalized bedGraph file to bigWig file.

   UCSC            Generate bedGraph files ready for submitting to UCSC genome browser.
```

##### Plot
```
   profile         Generate metagene profile for KAS-seq data (normalized bigWig files are needed).
   heatmap         Generate heatmap for KAS-seq data (normalized bigWig files are needed).
```

##### Differential KAS-seq analysis
```
   KASexpre        Calculate normalized KAS-seq expression levels on promoter, genebody, genes or custom regions. 
   diff            Perform differential KAS-seq analysis on promoter, genebody, gene, bin or custom regions.        
   TC              Perform 'case-only' or 'case-control' differential time course(TC) analysis for (sp)KAS-seq data.
   PCA             Perform and plot PCA analysis for (sp)KAS-seq data.
```
